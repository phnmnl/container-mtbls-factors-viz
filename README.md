# MTBLS Factors Viz 
Version: 0.5.0 

## Short Description

Creates parallel sets plots to show factor values distributions in samples inside an ISA-Tab document or MTBLS study. 

## Description

An R-based visualization for factors and their values as encoded in an ISA-Tab factor JSON output, or in MTBLS Parallel Coordinates JSON output. This implementation generates a static Parallel Sets Hammock plot using the ggparallel package.

## Key features

## Functionality

Each column on the graph shows a factor (the factor names are at the x axis label of the graph). The y-axis stands for the amount of samples. In this case, Dose=0 has 4 samples and Dose=280 has roughly 24 samples. Dose and Treatment seem to be redundant. All samples at Dose=0 (Treatment=PBS) are at Time=19 (which accounts for half of all Time=19 samples).

## Installation 

mtbls-factors-viz is present on all PhenoMeNal Galaxy instances on deployed Cloud Research Environments, under the ISA tools category in the tool bar to the left of the screen. No installation is needed hence on PhenoMeNal Cloud Research Environments.

For advanced Docker usage:

- Go to the directory where the dockerfile is.
- Create container from dockerfile:

```
docker build -t mtbls-factors-viz .
```

Alternatively, pull from repo:

```
docker pull container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu/phnmnl/mtbls-factors-viz
```
## Usage Instructions

On a PhenoMeNal Cloud Research Environment Galaxy environment, go to ISA tools tool category, and then click on mtbls-factors-viz, and either fill the `MetaboLights Study Identifer` field or `ISA-tab factors table in JSON format` input field (using a JSON generated by `factors summary` tool in the same category), then press Run. Additionally, the tool can be used as part of a workflow with the `factors summary` tool. 

Through docker

```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/data container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu/phnmnl/mtbls-factors-viz -s <MTBLS-ID> -o /data
```

or, if there is a factors summary JSON file on `factor_summary.json` in your working directory

```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/data container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu/phnmnl/mtbls-factors-viz -i /data/factor_summary.json -o /data
```
